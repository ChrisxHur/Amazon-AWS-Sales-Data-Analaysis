# Recommendations and Next Steps
- Investigate further as to why Enterprise sales are continuously lagging behind other segments. Can we look into further more years of data
to see a trend? Work with Finanace and Marketing team to figure out if we can setup more advertising within Enterprise segment
- First quarters of the year are falling behind in sales. Further investigation can be conducted within SaaS data in terms of quarterly sales
to find out if this is a AWS problem or is a trend within the SaaS industry. Work with marketing and Finance team to figure out potential campaigns
that can drive sales higher during Q1 and Q2.
- Having APJ showing low sales compared to other regions, further investigation can be conducted to see if there is a trend within the region 
to see if SaaS sales are not as common as other regions. This can result in either more advertising spend or if we want to allocate the budget to strengthen
the already other strong regions.
